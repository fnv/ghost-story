No path but the one I'm making, I suppose. I stepped over some low shrubbery, mud be damned. If I went around the manor, I might find the path to the gardens. To the garden. No turning back now.

I stumbled through the fog, keeping the manor to my right. Each window I passed was shuttered. A smaller door, perhaps a servant's entrance, was spotted with rust.
