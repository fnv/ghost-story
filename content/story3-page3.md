# The Fountain

At the center of the garden stands an ancient fountain. The water flows upward, defying gravity, and in its reflection you see not yourself, but the person you could become.

The fountain is made of white marble that seems to glow with its own inner light. The water that flows from it is crystal clear and sparkles like liquid diamonds. Most strangely, the water flows upward instead of down, creating a beautiful arc that defies the laws of physics.

As you approach the fountain, you notice that the water's surface acts like a mirror, but instead of showing your reflection, it shows you different versions of yourself. In one reflection, you're a successful artist, painting masterpieces that move people to tears. In another, you're a scientist making breakthrough discoveries. In a third, you're a teacher inspiring generations of students.

The reflections don't just show what you could be—they show what you might have been, and what you still could become. Each version of yourself seems to be looking back at you, as if they're all real in some parallel universe.

The most startling reflection shows you standing in this very garden, but you're not alone. There are other people there—people you love, people you've lost, and people you've yet to meet. They're all smiling, and you realize that this is what happiness looks like.
