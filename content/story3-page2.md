# The Garden

You open the door and find yourself in a beautiful garden that shouldn't exist inside a house. The flowers are in full bloom despite the late hour, and the air is filled with the scent of roses.

The garden is enormous, stretching far beyond what should be possible within the house's walls. The ceiling is open to a night sky filled with stars that seem to twinkle with an otherworldly light. The grass beneath your feet is soft and cool, and you can hear the gentle sound of water flowing somewhere nearby.

Roses of every color imaginable climb up trellises and walls, their petals glowing with an inner light. Butterflies with wings like stained glass flutter from flower to flower, and the air is alive with the hum of bees that work tirelessly despite the late hour.

The garden seems to exist in a perpetual twilight, where the sun has just set but the stars are already bright. The temperature is perfect—not too warm, not too cool—and there's a sense of peace here that you haven't felt anywhere else in the house.

As you walk deeper into the garden, you notice that the paths seem to lead you in circles, but each circle brings you to a different part of the garden that you're sure wasn't there before.
