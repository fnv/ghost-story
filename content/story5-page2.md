# The Lullaby

You begin to sing a lullaby, though you don't know the words. The crying stops, and you feel a small, cold hand take yours. A child's voice whispers, "Thank you for remembering."

The lullaby that comes from your lips is one you've never heard before, yet the words flow naturally, as if they've been waiting inside you all your life. It's a gentle melody about stars and dreams, about love that never ends, about a mother's promise to always be there.

As you sing, the room begins to change. The dust disappears, the colors become brighter, and the air fills with the warm scent of baby powder and fresh linen. The rocking chair stops moving, and you can feel a presence beside youâ€”small and fragile, like a candle flame in a strong wind.

The child's hand in yours is cold but not unpleasant, like holding a smooth stone from a riverbed. You can feel the child's gratitude and relief, as if you've given them something they've been waiting for for a very long time.

When the lullaby ends, the child's voice speaks again, clearer this time. "I was so lonely," it says. "No one has come to sing to me in so many years. I thought everyone had forgotten about me."
