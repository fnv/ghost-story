With a button's push, I quieted the engine of the rental car. Thick, heavy silence settled here as well. I dismissed the navigation and, automatically, the new unread emails and texts. I frowned at the weather status bar. Yes, forty degrees and heavy fog with no sign of a reprieve. If there'd been any wind at all, I might have made a nice day of it. Nice, sure. How could I think that? Even a perfect spring day wouldn't have made today "nice".
