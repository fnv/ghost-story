# The Landing

On the second floor landing, you see three doors. Behind one, you hear laughter. Behind another, crying. The third door is silent, but you feel a strong pull toward it.

The landing is dimly lit by a single gas lamp that flickers and sputters, casting dancing shadows across the walls. The three doors stand before you like portals to different worlds, each one emanating its own distinct energy.

The door with laughter behind it seems to glow with a warm, golden light. The sounds of merriment and music drift through the wood, inviting and cheerful.

The door with crying behind it is shrouded in a cold, blue mist. The sobs that echo through it are heart-wrenching and filled with an ancient sorrow.

The silent door in the middle seems to absorb all light and sound. It's perfectly still, yet you feel an irresistible compulsion to open it, as if it's calling to something deep within your soul.
