# The House

The old Victorian house stood at the end of Maple Street, its dark windows watching you approach. You've lived in this neighborhood for years, but tonight is the first time you've ever felt drawn to it.

The streetlights cast long shadows across the overgrown lawn, and the wind whispers through the trees like voices from another time. Something about this house calls to you, though you can't explain why.

You pause at the wrought-iron gate, its rusted hinges creaking softly in the breeze. Beyond it, a stone path leads to the front door, each step bringing you closer to whatever awaits inside.
