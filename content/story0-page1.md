# The Arrival

Misselthwaite Manor lurked somewhere beyond. I had reached the end of the driveway, where the road opened up into a bulb wide enough to drive in a complete circle, and could not yet see the manor itself. Thick, heavy fog had settled over the moor towards the end of my journey. A silent notification visited my mounted phone's screen: You have arrived.

With a button's push, I quieted the engine of the rental car. Thick, heavy silence settled here as well. I dismissed the navigation and, automatically, the new unread emails and texts. I frowned at the weather status bar. Yes, forty degrees and heavy fog with no sign of a reprieve. If there'd been any wind at all, I might have made a nice day of it. Nice, sure. How could I think that? Even a perfect spring day wouldn't have made today "nice".

Enough of that. The silence was getting to me. I stashed my phone and other necessities in my jacket pockets and disembarked. But the subsequent slam of the car door, and the crunch of each footstep on gravel was even more oppressive than the stillness had been.

Was I intruding? Would anyone come to demand an explanation? I realized the fog might be a blessing. I could do what I needed to do and leave, with no more trace than a ghost might leave.
