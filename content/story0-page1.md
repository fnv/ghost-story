Misselthwaite Manor lurked somewhere beyond. I had reached the end of the driveway, where the road opened up into a bulb wide enough to drive in a complete circle, and could not yet see the manor itself. Thick, heavy fog had settled over the moor towards the end of my journey. A silent notification visited my mounted phone's screen: You have arrived.

With a button's push, I quieted the engine of the rental car. Thick, heavy silence settled here as well. I dismissed the navigation and, automatically, the new unread emails and texts.
