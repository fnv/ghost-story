# The Nursery

Behind the door with crying, you find a child's nursery frozen in time. A rocking chair moves on its own, and you can hear a child sobbing, though no child is visible.

The nursery is perfectly preserved, as if it has been waiting for this moment. The walls are painted a soft blue, decorated with hand-painted murals of animals and fairy tale characters. A wooden crib stands in one corner, its white paint still bright and clean. Toys are scattered across the floor—a teddy bear, wooden blocks, a music box that plays a lullaby when you wind it.

The rocking chair in the center of the room moves back and forth rhythmically, though there's no one sitting in it. The wood creaks softly with each movement, and you can almost imagine a mother sitting there, rocking her child to sleep.

The crying you heard from outside the door is still there, but now it's softer, more plaintive. It seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once—from the walls, from the floor, from the very air itself. The sound is heartbreaking, filled with a loneliness that spans decades.

As you look around the room, you notice that everything is covered in a thin layer of dust, except for the rocking chair, which gleams as if it's been polished recently.
