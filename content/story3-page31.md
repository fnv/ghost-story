I had a house now, in my name, though it was far away from here. But it wasn't truly my own, not anymore. I couldn't imagine being there and trying to go on with my life without being constantly, in innumerably small ways, pulled back into the past.

I couldn't have kept that home, no matter how much I wanted it now. Sometimes things get taken, and there's nothing that you can do.
