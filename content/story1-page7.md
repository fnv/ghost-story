And next to the robin's shrub was a small stone path. 

I withdrew a scrap of paper from my pocket. A crude map with tiny handwritten labels. Ah, yes. The lines were so close together, I might have looked for this path branching off of the front walkway. But here it was instead, off of the driveway, the path that would take me straight to the manor's gardens.

With a flutter and a chirp, the robin shot off into the fog. I almost wanted to follow him, instead of seeing to my task. A robin is not much company, that's true, but for a brief moment I had not been alone. But I had to press on. There was no turning back now.
