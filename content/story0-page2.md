# The Manor

I stepped from the gravel of the drive to the smooth stone of a walkway. Seven, eight paces and I stopped short. My last step had abruptly moved me from an indefinite expanse of fog to a starkly divided world: the empty world behind me and the confining facade of the manor before me. No longer lurking, it loomed. Looking up and to the sides, as far as the fog would let me see, the stones and shutters of the manor waited.

The front door was just ahead of me, but why bother going inside? There was no one left here. No one but me, and I won't linger.

Won't linger intentionally, I suppose. I withdrew a scrap of paper from my pocket. A crude map with tiny handwritten labels. Wasn't there a footpath from the front door around to the garden? Of course, why should I assume that the drawing had been that accurate, drawn from childhood memories at such a remove of miles and years. Or that the landscaping had never been changed or updated?

I looked up to an empty balcony on the second story of the manor. Completely still, worn by years of wind and rain. It was difficult to imagine that any changes had taken place here for a hundred years or more.
