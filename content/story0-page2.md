# The Door

The front door is unlocked, which surprises you. As you step inside, the air feels thick with anticipation. Something is waiting for you here.

The foyer stretches before you, its high ceilings lost in shadow. Dust motes dance in the pale light filtering through the stained glass windows, and the floorboards creak beneath your feet like the house itself is breathing.

To your left, you hear the soft strains of music drifting from what might be a library. To your right, a grand staircase leads upward into darkness. Straight ahead, a corridor disappears into the depths of the house.

Each path seems to whisper its own invitation, but which will you choose?
