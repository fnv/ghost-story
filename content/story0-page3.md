# The Choice

You find yourself in a grand foyer, its walls lined with portraits whose eyes seem to follow your every move. The air is heavy with the scent of old wood and something else—something you can't quite identify.

To your left, you hear soft music coming from what might be a library. The melody is haunting and familiar, though you're certain you've never heard it before.

To your right, there's a staircase leading up to darkness. The steps seem to go on forever, disappearing into shadows that move and shift like living things.

Straight ahead, a corridor leads deeper into the house. The walls seem to pulse with a strange energy, and you can almost see the air shimmering with possibility.

Each path calls to you in its own way. The choice is yours, but remember—once you choose, there's no turning back.
