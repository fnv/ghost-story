# The Path

No path but the one I'm making, I suppose. I stepped over some low shrubbery, mud be damned. If I went around the manor, I might find the path to the gardens. To the garden. No turning back now.

I stumbled through the fog, keeping the manor to my right. Each window I passed was shuttered. A smaller door, perhaps a servant's entrance, was spotted with rust.

As I came to the corner of the manor, I felt the barest hint of a breeze. Even through the thick fog, I could feel the grounds opening up before me. Indeed, the ground sloped gently downward away from the house. Taking care to not slip on the grass, I descended. Just as the manor faded into fog behind me, I found myself stepping onto a small path of stones.

Not lost at all. You can do this, Rose. Do this, and you can rest.
