But perhaps Misselthwaite Manor was known for its gardens, and a previous caller had been looking to walk through them. It didn't mean that someone was expecting me. How could they? I had barely explained it toâ€”

As if at a great distance, I heard a robin's call. *Chirr tu wee, tu wit. Tu wee, tu wit.*
