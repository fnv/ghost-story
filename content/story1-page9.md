The path eventually started to descend, and I left the house on the hill behind me. I felt the barest hint of a breeze. Even through the thick fog, I could feel the grounds opening up before me. The stones beneath my feet were steady and sure. 

I'd found my way more easily than I expected. You can do this, Rose. Do this, and you can rest.

Two waist-high hedges extended away in either direction, and the stone pathway split to lead around the outside of the garden in either direction. But directly in front of me, the hedges parted and formed an archway covered in ivy. I brushed a dangling strand aside and entered the gardens.
