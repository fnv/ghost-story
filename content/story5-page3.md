# The Peace

The child's spirit finds peace and fades away, leaving behind a small toy. You realize this house is a place where lost souls come to find closure, and you've helped one find its way home.

As you hold the child's hand, you feel a warmth spreading through the room. The child's spirit begins to glow with a soft, golden light, and you can see them now—a little girl in a white nightgown, with curly hair and bright eyes that sparkle with joy.

"I remember now," she says, her voice clear and happy. "I remember my mother singing that lullaby to me every night. I remember how much she loved me, and how she promised to always watch over me."

The child's form begins to fade, but this time it's not sad—it's beautiful, like watching a butterfly emerge from its cocoon. The golden light grows brighter, and you can see other lights joining it, forming a path that leads upward toward the ceiling.

"Thank you," the child whispers as she begins to fade. "You helped me remember that I was loved. Now I can go home."

When she's gone, you find yourself holding a small wooden toy—a carved bird that fits perfectly in your palm. It's warm to the touch, and when you look at it, you can almost hear the sound of a child's laughter echoing through the house.

You realize that this house isn't just haunted—it's a sanctuary, a place where lost souls can find the peace they need to move on. And by helping them, you've found something precious yourself.
