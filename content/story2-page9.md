The call sounded again, closer. Tu wee, chirr chirr. Tu wit, chirree. I turned away from the front door and moved through the fog toward the robin. Chirr, tu wee.

I found him just a quarter turn around the driveway, happily singing to himself. His funny red face was a welcome splash of color amidst the white fog, gray stones, and muted green plants of the manor.

And next to the robin's shrub was a small stone path. 

I withdrew a scrap of paper from my pocket. A crude map with tiny handwritten labels. Ah, yes. The lines were so close together, I might have looked for this path branching off of the front walkway. But here it was instead, off of the driveway, the path that would take me straight to the manor's gardens.
