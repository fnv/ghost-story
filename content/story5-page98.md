If I looked back, I might not be able to leave again. Part of me wanted to stay. Whatever this was, it was easier than heading back out into the misty world, alone. It was easier, but not better. Not for me.

As I reached the end of the front walkway, my hand was pulled back behind me. This was the last moment. Her little hand felt warm in mine. I held onto that feeling until I knew the memory of it would be exact. That I'd always have that, and the memory of the warm dining room, if nothing else.
