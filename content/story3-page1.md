# The Corridor

The corridor stretches endlessly before you, lined with doors that seem to shift and change as you walk. Each door leads to a different possibility, a different version of reality.

The walls of the corridor are covered in wallpaper that changes pattern as you pass—one moment it's floral, the next geometric, then abstract swirls that seem to move and flow like liquid. The floor beneath your feet feels unstable, as if you're walking on water rather than solid ground.

The doors along the corridor are all different—some are ancient oak with iron hinges, others are modern steel with electronic locks. Some are painted bright colors, others are carved with symbols you don't recognize. Each one pulses with its own energy, calling to you in different ways.

As you walk, you notice that the corridor itself seems to be breathing. The walls expand and contract slightly, and the air shimmers with possibilities. You can almost see the different realities bleeding through the walls, like reflections in a broken mirror.

One door in particular catches your attention. It's made of a material you can't identify—it looks like wood but seems to be growing, with small leaves sprouting from its surface.
