This secret garden was green, and damp, and wild, yes. But it had been overrun with purple moorland heather. The floor of the garden was coated with it, and it had run up the side of a large tree near the center. The climbing roses that had been intentionally planted here coated the inner walls, dripping down to touch the top of the heather. And it was all in bloom. The roses on the walls, and what had to be snowdrops and crocuses and daffodils trying to burst their way up through the heather. More purple, yellow, brilliant white, some reds and pinks. This garden was somehow warm, and full, and alive.
