The front door was just ahead of me, but what was that, just there? Pinched under the knocker was an envelope, looking rather damp but still intact. There was no one living here, though. Who would think to send mail?

I couldn't help being curious. I pulled the envelope free. I could put it right back, after all. Inside was a small piece of card, with a scrawled note.
