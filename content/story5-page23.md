A wide path with grass on either side led forward to a small pool. The pool was very low, filled more with damp leaves and dirt than water, and the fountain at its center was dry.

The fog made each branching path seem identical — an infinite series of opportunities or, rather, a bleak acknowledgement that whatever path I took was exactly the same.
