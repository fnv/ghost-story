To my heirs, my lovely flower girls. I have been so lucky to live a long life, travel the world, and see your wonderful families blossom. But my mind has been on the past, of late. When I left England, I left a whole life behind me. So many friends I said goodbye to without realizing it would be the last time I saw them. How I long to be there again, one last time. I am too frail to visit, of course, though I know the way. But after I am gone, if it's not too much trouble, please bring me home. Bring me to my garden.
