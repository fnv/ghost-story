The door swung shut behind me, and I heard a bolt lock into place.

The entrance to Misselthwaite Manor was a grand hall, with double staircases heading to the second floor and a sparkling chandelier. Portraits of Cravens going back hundreds of years lined the wall. I expected it to be dusty, even mildewy, but the interior was spotless.

And it was so good to be inside, out of the wind. The air was warm, and I could smell chicken roasting alongside the potatoes. The whine of a kettle sounded. And Mary was standing in a doorway, framed by golden light. She nodded her head at me, and stepped inside.
