The door swung shut behind me, and I heard a bolt lock into place.

The entrance to Misselthwaite Manor was a grand hall, with double staircases heading to the second floor and a sparkling chandelier. Portraits of Cravens going back hundreds of years lined the wall. I expected it to be dusty, even mildewy, but the interior was spotless.

And it was so good to be inside, out of the wind. The air was warm, and I could smell chicken roasting alongside the potatoes. The whine of a kettle sounded. And Mary was standing in a doorway, framed by golden light. She nodded her head at me, and stepped inside.

I ran across the hall and followed her into the dining room. Though it could serve a large party on grand occasions, leaves had been taken from the table so that it comfortably fit a small family.

Dickon the driver was laughing with an older woman in an apron. I presumed this to be Martha, the mistress of the house. She looked to be sixty or seventy years old, about the same age as Mr. Craven.
