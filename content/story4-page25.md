It was a rose garden. I'd never seen a rose garden and not thought, with some unearned pride, "my garden, mine." The roses weren't in bloom of course, but I knew that I'd found the right place. The note on the door had said I should take the stone bridge out of the rose garden, and here I was. Though I couldn't see anything that looked like a bridge. The fog was stirring around me in small eddies, but still made it hard to see more than a few feet away. I closed my eyes instead. I could hear the sound of water trickling off to my right.
