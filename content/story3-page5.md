We hadn't spoken much on the journey. Since I'd met him this morning, I'd noticed he held himself like a military man ready for his officer's inspection, though his yellow-green vintage coat and pants made him look more like someone planning to attend a reenactment than an actual solider. Most of my small talk received a curt, "Aye, lass, I'm sure." He'd tried to start up a conversation about family, but he picked up pretty quickly that I didn't want to dwell on the subject. I think I caught him watching me nervously twisting at my ring finger, where I used to wear my wedding ring. Thankfully I'd discovered a subject that could help us pass the time â€” he liked talking about the moorland itself, and the plants and birds we saw. He even groused a bit about the bad weather.
