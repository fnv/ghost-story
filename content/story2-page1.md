# The Stairs

The staircase creaks with each step as you ascend into darkness. The air grows colder, and you can hear whispers coming from the rooms above.

The wooden steps are worn smooth by countless feet that have climbed them before you. Each creak seems to echo through the house like a voice from the past, and the shadows on the walls seem to move with a life of their own.

As you climb higher, the temperature drops noticeably. Your breath forms small clouds in the air, and you can feel the presence of something watching you from the darkness above.

The whispers grow louder as you reach the second floor landing, and you realize they're not just echoesâ€”they're voices, speaking in languages you don't recognize.
