Four days later, I uncovered the box with my great-grandmother Mary's ashes.

I pulled my jacket tighter. The breeze was steady now. When had that started? My legs were getting cold. I stood and took a right turn, striding off into the fog, trying to be decisive and shake off the chill. Trying to get the momentum back, lest I lose my nerve. Lest I turn back before I was through.

I didn't have much luck, though. The first path I took ended at a tall hedge, and the second I tried ended at an overgrown and tightly shuttered iron gate. Every path different, but ultimately a dead end. The map I carried wasn't of any use, either. It had been drawn as if the path went straight through this part of the garden.
