# The Book

One book on the shelf seems to glow with an inner light. As you reach for it, the pages begin to turn on their own, revealing a story that feels strangely familiar.

The book's cover is made of a material you can't identify—it feels like leather but seems to pulse with life beneath your fingertips. The title is written in an elegant script that seems to shift and change as you look at it.

When you open the book, the pages turn themselves, stopping at a passage that describes exactly what you're doing right now. The words seem to write themselves as you read, telling the story of your journey through this house.

You realize with growing horror that this book is telling your story—but it's a story that hasn't happened yet. The pages continue to fill with text, describing events that are about to unfold.

The book is reading you as much as you're reading it.
