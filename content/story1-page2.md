With a button's push, I quieted the engine of the rental car. Thick, heavy silence settled here as well. I dismissed the navigation and, automatically, the new unread emails and texts. I frowned at the weather status bar. Yes, forty degrees and heavy fog with no sign of a reprieve. If there'd been any wind to blow the fog away, there might have been some nice sun. Nice, sure. How could I think that? Even a perfect spring day wouldn't have made today "nice".
