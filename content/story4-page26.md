Heading in that direction, I passed a moss-covered stone wall. The top of the wall stepped up and down in crenellations, like the tops of a castle. I put my hand on the stone, and a memory came rushing back.

I was waiting outside the door leading into a castle, idly running my hands over the stones. Mom had coaxed me and Lily into our scratchy church dresses that we hadn't worn in months. I'd grown, and discovered that there was far more leg that I expected showing between my socks and my skirt. We'd driven to the castle, or what had seemed to us to be a castle. I suppose it had been a country club, or a rich person's home. Mom had rang the doorbell, and we'd heard an actual bell ringing behind the large wooden door. The waiting was stretching on and on, and I was nervous, so I traced the stone of the wall with my hands.
