A wide path with grass on either side led forward to a small pool. The pool was very low, filled more with damp leaves and dirt than water, and the fountain at its center was dry. I took a turn about the fountain, and passed three identical paths before ending up where I'd begun. The fog made each branching path seem identical — an infinite series of opportunities or, rather, a bleak acknowledgement that whatever path I took was exactly the same. But thinking back to the note… was this the fountain? Did that mean I should turn left, instead of pressing forward? I'd be blindly trusting instructions left for another, and, well, no, that wasn't right. That wasn't what I really believed. Though it made no sense, I felt like the guidance must have been for me.
