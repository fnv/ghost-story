# The Party

Behind the door with laughter, you find a grand ballroom filled with people in Victorian dress. They're dancing to music that seems to come from nowhere, and they all turn to look at you as you enter.

The ballroom is magnificent, with crystal chandeliers that sparkle like stars and a polished marble floor that reflects the candlelight. The walls are covered in gold-framed mirrors that seem to multiply the room's size infinitely. The air is filled with the scent of perfume and candle wax, and the sound of rustling silk and taffeta.

The people in the ballroom are dressed in the finest Victorian fashion—women in elaborate gowns with corsets and bustles, men in tailcoats and top hats. They move with an elegance that seems almost supernatural, their dance steps perfectly synchronized to music that you can't quite place.

As you step into the room, all conversation stops and every head turns toward you. The dancers pause mid-step, and you can feel dozens of eyes studying you with a mixture of curiosity and something else—recognition, perhaps?

The most unsettling thing is that while they all look at you, none of them speak. They simply watch, their expressions ranging from amusement to concern to what might be pity.
