# The Revelation

The book tells your storyâ€”but it's a story that hasn't happened yet. You realize this house exists outside of time, and you're reading your own future.

As you turn the pages, you see yourself in different rooms of the house, making choices you haven't made yet. The book shows you multiple paths, multiple versions of yourself, each one leading to a different outcome.

Some pages show you finding great treasures, others show you facing terrible dangers. Some show you leaving the house forever, while others show you becoming part of it, your spirit joining the countless others who have walked these halls.

The most disturbing revelation is that the book is still being written. The pages continue to fill with new text even as you read, and you realize that your choices in this moment are determining what appears on the next page.

You are both the reader and the author of your own destiny.
