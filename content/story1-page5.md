The front door was just ahead of me, but why bother going inside? There was no one left here. No one but me, and I won't linger.

As if at a great distance, I heard a robin's call. Chirr tu wee, tu wit. Tu wee, tu wit.

No one left but a lonely robin, I suppose. My grandmother's namesake. I remembered sitting with Grandma Robin on the porch swing, hearing her singing to the robins in the trees.
