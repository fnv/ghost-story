# The Mirror

You choose the silent door and find yourself in a room with a large mirror. When you look into it, you don't see your reflection—you see yourself in different moments of your life.

The mirror is enormous, stretching from floor to ceiling, its frame carved with intricate patterns that seem to move and shift as you watch. The glass itself has a strange quality, as if it's not reflecting the present but showing you glimpses of other times.

As you approach, you see yourself as a child, playing in a garden you don't remember. Then you see yourself as an old person, sitting in a rocking chair by a fireplace. The images shift and change, showing you versions of yourself that could have been, or might yet be.

The most disturbing thing is that the reflections don't just show you—they show you interacting with people you've never met, in places you've never been. It's as if the mirror is showing you the lives you could have lived, the choices you could have made.

One reflection catches your eye: it shows you standing in this very room, but you're not alone. There's someone else there, someone who looks exactly like you but isn't you.
