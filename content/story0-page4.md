# The Garden

The stone pathway led me to part of the grounds that could only be the manor's gardens. Two waist-high hedges extended away in either direction, and the stone pathway split to lead around the outside of the garden in either direction. But directly in front of me, the hedges parted and formed an archway covered in ivy. I brushed a dangling strand aside and entered the gardens.

The fog was thinner here, though still present. I could see the outlines of what had once been carefully tended flower beds, now overgrown with weeds and wildflowers. The stone path continued through the center of the garden, leading deeper into the grounds.

Ahead, I could make out the dark shapes of trees and what might be a small structureâ€”perhaps a gazebo or summer house. The air was still, but not as oppressive as it had been near the manor. Here, there was a sense of peace, of time standing still.

I took a deep breath and continued forward. This was what I had come for. This was where I would find what I was looking for.
