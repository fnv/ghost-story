The path led to an ivy-covered archway, the ivy now waving a bit in the breeze. It looked a lot like the entrance I'd just come through. I peered through the archway into another garden.

It was a rose garden. I'd never seen a rose garden and not thought, with some unearned pride, "my garden, mine." The roses weren't in bloom of course, but I knew that I'd found the right place.
